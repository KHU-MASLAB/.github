## Welcome to Modeling and Simulation (M&S) lab (Jin-Gyun Kim's group) 

We are in Department of Mechanical Engineering at Kyung Hee University. We develop computational modeling and simulation  methods of structures based on classical mechanics, in particular, for dynamics and vibration.
Our current academic focus is to develop numerical methods for the following issues:  
* ***Deterministic/stochastic M&S***  
* ***Multi-physics M&S***  
* ***Data driven M&S (In particular, for digital twin, virtual sensing and real-time simulation)***  
* ***Engineering applications***
  
We also tackle broad range projects of vibration, dynamics and CAE issues with both academic and industrial partners. For more information, please visit our [website](https://sites.google.com/site/modelingnsimulation).
